# Project: Data Transfer between Servers Using Sockets
## Description
This project implements a data transfer system between servers using sockets. The objective is to allow direct communication between a local database and a remote server, transmitting data efficiently and securely.

Main Features Data Transfer via Sockets:

Using sockets to establish a direct and secure connection between the source server and the destination server. Sending Data in Real Time:

Transmission of data from the local database to the remote server in real time, ensuring constant information updating. Transmission Security:

Implementation of security mechanisms, such as encryption, to protect data during transfer. Connection Management:

Efficient control of socket connections, including opening, maintaining and safely closing connections.
